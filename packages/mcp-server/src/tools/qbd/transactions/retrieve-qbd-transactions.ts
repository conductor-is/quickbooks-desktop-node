    "When using this tool, always use the `jq_filter` parameter to reduce the response size and improve performance.\n\nOnly omit if you're sure you don't need the data.\n\nRetrieves a transaction by ID.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If you need to fetch multiple specific transactions by ID, use the list endpoint instead with the `ids` parameter. It accepts an array of IDs so you can batch the request into a single call, which is significantly faster.\n\n# Response Schema\n```json\n{\n  $ref: '#/$defs/transaction',\n  $defs: {\n    transaction: {\n      type: 'object',\n      title: 'The Transaction object',\n      properties: {\n        account: {\n          type: 'object',\n          description: 'The account associated with this transaction.',\n          properties: {\n            id: {\n              type: 'string',\n              description: 'The unique identifier assigned by QuickBooks to this object.
